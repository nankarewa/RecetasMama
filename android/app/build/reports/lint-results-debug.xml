        id="UnusedAttribute"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Attribute `usesCleartextTraffic` is only used in API level 23 and higher (current min is 21)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Attribute unused on older versions"
        explanation="This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the `minSdkVersion` attribute).&#xA;&#xA;This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.&#xA;&#xA;Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags can be unused too, such as the new `&lt;tag>` element in layouts introduced in API 21."

        id="ObsoleteSdkInt"
        severity="Warning"
        message="This folder configuration (`v21`) is unnecessary; `minSdkVersion` is 21. Merge all the resources in this folder into `drawable`."
        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Obsolete SDK_INT Version Check"
        explanation="This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the `minSdkVersion` (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, it also looks for resources in `-vNN` folders, such as `values-v14` where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the `minSdkVersion`, where the contents should be merged into the best folder.">

        id="IconLauncherShape"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details"
        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="6"
        summary="The launcher icon shape should use a distinct silhouette"
        explanation="According to the Android Design Guide (https://material.io/design/iconography/) your launcher icons should &quot;use a distinct silhouette&quot;, a &quot;three-dimensional, front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a filled square.">

        summary="Icon density-independent size validation"
        explanation="Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute to roughly the same density-independent pixel (`dip`) size. This catches errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.">
